Hello!

Welcome to Adequate Games. We make games that are, you know, alright.

My name is Kane, and I'm a game developer based in Melbourne, Australia. You may remember me from such things as [Chess Together](https://sidequestvr.com/app/2606/chess-together), [Hotham](https://github.com/leetvr/hotham) or my overly ambitious VR game, [The Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fecn1qPNu3c).

My newest project is Clipper (working title!), a game about building paperclips. Lots, and lots of paperclips. In medieval Iceland. As an alien AI with mind control powers.

In this blog I'll document the highs and lows, joys and mind-boggling complexity of building a management game from scratch, without using any pre-existing game engines. Which is sort of a stupid idea, really. Like I wouldn't recommend it. What the hell am I doing?

I hope you enjoy the ride.
