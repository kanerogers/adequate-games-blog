Hello!

Welcome to Adequate Games. We make games that are within the acceptable parameters of enjoyment.

My name is Kane, and I'm a game developer based in Melbourne, Australia. You may remember me from such things as [Chess Together](https://sidequestvr.com/app/2606/chess-together), [Hotham](https://github.com/leetvr/hotham) or my overly ambitious VR game, [The Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fecn1qPNu3c).

My newest project is Clipper (working title!), a game about building paperclips. Lots, and lots of paperclips. In medieval Iceland. As an alien AI with mind control powers. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/kanerogers/clipper/issues/1).

In this blog I'll document the highs and lows, joys and mind-boggling complexity of building a management game from scratch, without using any pre-existing game engines. Which is sort of a stupid idea, really. Like I wouldn't recommend it. What the hell am I doing?
